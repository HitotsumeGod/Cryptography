Cryptograph has a few key features: a lack of any determined key, opting instead for a random number that determines the size and arrangement of code chunks,
night characters, which are characters that are generated via the random number but mean nothing; they are automatically removed upon the translator detecting them
the double night character; there is one in every single program; it does nothing, but is ignored rather than removed
WIN_BXE, the tddfdfdfor every chunk of code; without WIN_BXE at the start the translator will shutdown
characters are:
main chars, combined they equal letters = !$%^&*<>?

sample generation key (x = randnum, parentheses affect next char, not prior):
