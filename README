WIN_BXE is a cipher program that, rather than relying on a single static key, generates enciphered text using a randomized key that is deciphered via a swift and powerful engine that has to do all of the deciphering by hand, without any aid or knowledge from the text generator. The upside of this is that it makes it more difficult for interlopers to determine the cipher key based on the enciphered text. The downside is that it requires significantly more computing power to translate enciphered text.
To build:
make
To use:
./generator <filename> (this deletes the file used, and stores its contents internally, so for subsequent attempts with the same file, just use ./generator with no arguments)
./translator
the enciphered and deciphered text files can be found in the 'res' directory
cipher character key:
'a' = <(x+2)$(2x)^
'b' = ??(x)!
'c' = ^^^(x+1)!

'f' = >>>(x)$!
